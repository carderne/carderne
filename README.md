### Hi, I'm Chris

I’m a software/infra/data engineer and love building and breaking and tinkering.
If I’m inside but not at the computer, I’m probably reading. And when outside, I’d ideally be climbing mountains but more frequently running and cycling.

Currently I’m building [Translucent](https://www.translucent.io/), the next-gen multi-entity accountancy SaaS.

I’ve been lucky enough to work across the tech spectrum: designing systems, building apps and services, exploring data, taming models.

By day I write Python (with Pyright set to hard mode) and TypeScript (tRPC + Next.js aren’t so bad), while by night I enjoy Go and Rust and playing with LLMs (because who doesn’t).

I’ve worked with some hot startups in the finance, climate and energy spaces, supported top research institutions and multinationals.
